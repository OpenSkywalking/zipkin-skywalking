# Zipkin-SkyWalking Exporter
**Zipkin-SkyWalking Exporter** supports Apache SkyWalking's collector accept [Zipkin trace format](https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans).
This extends SkyWalking to the OpenZipkin ecosystem, by allowing existing applications to send data to SkyWalking. We accomplish this by mapping the spans to [SkyWalking Trace Data Protocol](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/Trace-Data-Protocol.md)

**Note: currently an trace can only include data from SkyWalking agents or Zipkin instrumentation, but not both.** [W3C distributed-tracing specification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking) may help some day, still need further discussion.

* Zipkin v2: https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans
* SkyWalking 5.x: [SkyWalking Trace Data Protocol](https://github.com/apache/incubator-skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/Trace-Data-Protocol.md)

# Data Models Mapping
## Trace 
A set of spans that share a single root span. TraceId maps the GlobalTraceId in SkyWalking.

## TraceSegment
No TraceSegment concept in Zipkin. Require [Trace and TraceSegment Rebuid mechanism](#trace-and-tracesegment-rebuid-mechanism).

## Span
In SkyWalking, Span is just a concept, not real. There are three sub-concept, and real classes are EntrySpan, LocalSpan and ExitSpan.

LocalSpan and ExitSpan relate RPC and MQ, mapping Zipkin's Span with RemoteEndpoint.

### TraceId, SpanId, ParentSpanId
All these three IDs are String in Zipkin, and format is 
```
maxLength: 32
minLength: 16
pattern: [a-z0-9]{16,32}
```

In SkyWalking, TraceId is a combination by three Integers. SpanId and ParentSpanId are small Integers, start with 0 in each TraceSegment. There two IDs need to be generated in [Trace and TraceSegment Rebuid](#trace-and-tracesegment-rebuid-mechanism) process.

### Span's timestamp
Epoch microseconds of the start of this span. This equivalent to SkyWalking Span's startTime, but the Unit of SkyWalking is milliseconds.

### Span's duration
**duration** is in microseconds (1 millisecond is 1000 microseconds). SkyWalking has only endTime in milliseconds. So, Zipkin-Span timestamp + duration = SkyWalking-Span endTime.

### Span's LocalEndpoint
Application listening address, includes IPv4, IPv6 and port. usually the link local IP.

**SkyWalking Mapping**: Server identify and InstanceDiscoveryService, including register, heartbeat. 

### Span's RemoteEndpoint
RemoteEndpoint represents the peer network address and service name for a RPC or MQ(broker). In SkyWalking, service name maps ExitSpan's operationName, and ip(v4/v6) + port maps ExitSpan's peer by combining these two as a String with `:`.

### Annotations
Annotation can be considered as Log in SkyWalking, but no key. So convert it to log with the default log.key=`zipkin` (Zipkin Annotation).

### Tags
Tags included in both Zipkin and SkyWalking. And for further analysis and aggregation. Here is the mapping table based on [Zipkin core define](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-api/blob/master/thrift/zipkinCore.thrift). Zipkin tags can also include arbitrary data. Conventionally, tag keys longer than 255 characters are not indexed.

| Data required by SkyWalking | Possible Keys in Zipkin |
|----|-----|
|Error occurs in this Span scope.| **error** | 
|Componenet library name. e.g. Feign, Resttemplate| **lc** |
|Layer of this Span. e.g. Database, RPCFramework, Http, MQ, Cache | Presume non, must be conjectured by Component library name or other tags|
|SQL statement| **sql.query** |
|Database Type| |
|HTTP URL| **http.url** |
|HTTP Status Code| **http.status_code** |
|HTTP method| **http.method** |
|MQ topic/queue name | No |

# Trace and TraceSegment Rebuid mechanism
## Why need rebuild mechanism
SkyWalking analysis traces by trace segment, not span. So the rebuild process is about to buffer the upload spans, rebuild them into several segments, based on a trace segment rebuild timeout threshold.

- Rationale of **timeout threshold**: No one can tell when, where and how a trace end, even for a same service, it changes time to time, because codes upgrade, different parameter or status data. And also this is why SkyWalking use a complex HEAD/SegmentRef to allow analysis and aggregation program didn't expect a full trace to analysis. However, this is impossible for rebuilding process.

## Process flow

                                                        |   SkyWalking gRPC services                        |
                                                        +------------------------------------>  Analysis and Aggregation
```

## Requirement
An additional **Tag**, key is `app.code`. Every application under traced should be an explicit application code, in order to show in SkyWalking Topology, Application list etc.
